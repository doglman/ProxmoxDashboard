Final Project: Sam Swindler, Benj McKinnon, Jensen Wood, Spencer Baird

Project:
Resource Monitoring Dashboard for Data Center Infrastructure - Proxmox

Goal:
Create a web-based Resource Monitoring Dashboard with user authentication, real-time data visualization, and alerting capabilities to monitor computer resources. This dashboard will offer a comprehensive overview of data center infrastructure VM status and performance metrics from Proxmox. Users will be able to manage resources efficiently, provision and de-provision VMs, and receive notifications for critical events.


Steps:
Our project is broken into 4 main steps. These steps were used to create easy partitions of work, and lead to the ultimate completion of the project.
1. Hardware setup and Proxmox installation
2. Network Configuration
3. Server Backend
4. Website Frontend

This documentation will be a log of what we did, how we did it, the problems we ran into, and will be able to lead anyone through making their own Proxmox.
